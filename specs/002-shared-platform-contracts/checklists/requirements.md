# Specification Quality Checklist: Shared Platform Foundation and API Contracts

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 passed all checklist items.
- The specification names platform concepts such as contracts, service operations, clients, and
  production artifacts because they are the subject of Phase 1, while avoiding implementation
  language, package layouts, framework choices, and code-level design.
- No clarification markers were required. Scope defaults were derived from the Phase 1 roadmap,
  the engineering constitution, and the explicit boundary that identity redesign and later domain
  features remain out of scope.
